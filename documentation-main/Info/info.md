# About us
We are a company that wants to make an incredibly useful human accessory possible, enabling humans to improve their daily quality of life. That's why we want to make our product, called MarsPads.

MarsPads is a product that you can stick to the outsides of your ears. It is waterproof and dust resistant. It allows you to hear sounds by sending vibrations to the inner ear. The pads can be taken off whenever you want, they are completely recyclable and only have to be charged once a week.

This chip can be very interesting for people working in environments with lots of noise. It can be a focus booster for many people that are easily distracted by sounds. It is also a way of getting rid of those annoying earbuds. It sticks to your head so they can’t fall out as earbuds do. They don’t have wires and they have a battery life way longer than any other earbuds. 

Another main feature is the build in the echolocational system. The pads send out a signal which gives you the option to see your surroundings on a map. This map shows you the exits, sounds and people within your proximity. Wich of course you can navigate to and call.

# Future
As a company, we always want to improve our products. That's why we want to work together with a chip-making company in the future to integrate our product as a chip that connects to a user's brain. That way we can even have longer battery life and an easier way of delivering audio to a user. This chip would have to be made in collaboration with a chip fabricant. We could also use the input from a person's eyes and essentially turn someone’s eyes into a camera, and possibly implement image recognition with this as well.

# Security
Security is a big part of every company, we store users' contacts and calls, so we took good measurements for our security.

We decided to outsource the security since we believe this would mean very skilled people will monitor the data and are more prone to react if something does go wrong. A specific security company will be more prepared for hackers and will cost more, but at the end of the day, we cannot survive a data breach.

To secure all data we also opted to outsource the data storage. We will let another company manage this, and will spread it around mars. This makes it so if one server malfunctions, we have no data loss and remain intact. This will cost a lot because there is a lot of hardware needed to store it, but it is way safer.
